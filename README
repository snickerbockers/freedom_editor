== THE FREEEDOM EDITOR
================================================================================

The Freedom Editor is (err...will be) a complete modding toolkit for the 2014
game "Freedom Planet".  This includes the ability to edit levels, and replace
art assets.

Currently Freedom Editor only supports the 64-bit GNU/Linux version of the
game, and it has only been tested on the GoG release (although the Steam
release will probably work as well).  Windows support will come eventually.

== PREREQUISITES:
================================================================================

* Python 2.7
* radare2
* r2pipe

================================================================================
== INSTRUCTIONS:
================================================================================

Freedom Editor is built around the concept of projects, which are directories
containing a copy of your game installation and all of the level and art assets
in a dumped form.  To create a new project, the following command should be run:

tools/fp_project.py create -i <path to game installation> <path to project>

<path to project> is where you want to save the project.
<path to game installation> should point to the directory where the game is
                  installed.  Its contents should look something like this:

.mojosetup/                  game/                        start.sh                     uninstall-Freedom Planet.sh
docs/                        gameinfo                     support/

This script has a lot of data to sift through, so it will take several minutes
to complete.

At this point, your project directory will contain the following directories:
assets - dumped version of Assets.dat
levels - dumped version of the game levels
bkup   - backup copies of bin64/Chowdren and Assets.dat for generating patches
         against
inst   - copy of your game installation

At this point you can edit the pos_x and pos_y attributes in the level files to
change the positions of in-game objects.  Changing the obj_class field (which
controls what type of object is spawned) might also work but I haven't gotten
around to testing it.  The other fields are dangerous and should not be edited.

You can also edit any of the files in the assets/ directory, but you should be
wary of type_sizes.txt and anything ending in *_meta.txt because I don't know
what the data in those files is meant to represent.

To compile your mod, run the following command:
tools/fp_project.py build <path to project>

This will update the copies of Assets.dat and bin64/Chowdren in your inst/
subdirectory.

The modded game can then be launched by running:
tools/fp_project.py launch <path to project>
